      <p>Hi, I'm Alex.</p>
      <p>I'm a learner - I need to be learning something new to be happy. I've studied philosophy, 
        physics, violin, and web development. I know a lot about online payments. At the moment I'm learning to speak Tagalog (the Filipino language). Nakakaintindi ako ng kaunting Tagalog!</p>
      <p>I want to be a force for good. I've taken the <a href="https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/pledge" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Giving What We Can pledge</a>: 
        I give at least 10% of my income to the organisations that can most effectively 
      use it to improve the lives of others.</p>
      <p>I believe that kindness matters, and I'm interested in mental health and positive psychology. </p>

          <p class="card-text">From October 18 to November 19 2021, Adyen employees in APAC used a wellbeing challenge web app I built. 
            You could log activities such as a good nightsâ€™ sleep, a break during the workday, meditation, or exercise. 
          By scoring points with these activities, we were tracing a route between our offices on the map.</p>
          <p class="card-text pb-4">We reached our goal, and as a result, Adyen donated 18,833 SGD to <a href="https://equalizehealth.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Equalize Health</a>. The charity's board decided to match our donation and doubled our impact.</p>

          <p class="card-text">During the Sydney lockdown in August 2021, I got our local team to participate in Fred's Big Run, 
            a yearly fundraiser organised by the <a href="https://www.hollows.org/au/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fred&nbsp;Hollows Foundation</a>.</p>
          <p class="card-text pb-4">We <a href="https://www.fredsbigrun.org/fundraisers/AdyenTeam" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised $7,574</a> with 14 team members, and by doing so we helped restore sight to up to 303 people.
