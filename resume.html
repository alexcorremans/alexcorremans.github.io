        <p><i class="fas fa-quote-left"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I so greatly value the time I have had working with Alex - 
          I could not have asked for a better manager.</p>
        <p>She encouraged me to set personal targets that made my job a rewarding challenge, while always being there to support me along the way.</p>
        <p>At the same time she is incredibly empathetic - on more than one occasion she sensed when I was stressed 
          and needed a hand. In my experience, tech is filled with passionate people who can often push themselves to 
          the limit. Having someone like Alex, who recognised the crucial importance of balancing work and mental health is invaluable.</p>
        <p>Finally, Alex is always there for a chat when I had technical queries - I loved the discussions we 
          would have about the nitty gritty aspects of tech support. Sometimes I would ask a question she didn’t 
          immediately know the answer to and I would go elsewhere for the info. For most people that would be 
          the end of it, but Alex would almost always come back to me at some point, having followed up on the 
          subject and found more interesting information about it. That's the kind of dedication that made me 
          want to do my job as well as she did hers.</p>
        <p>I can’t wait to see what Alex does next and I know that wherever she goes, they will be lucky to have her.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i class="fas fa-quote-right"></i></p>

          initiatives and advocating for change. Outside of her team lead role and with her enthusiasm and persistence, Alex has ensured 
          the rollout of number of wellbeing initiatives and resources to support her fellow colleagues. We have all benefited 
          from Alex's contributions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i class="fas fa-quote-right"></i></p>

          I’ve seen her go above and beyond her role at many occasions helping customers solving their issues, 
          investigating complex technical bugs, taking leadership in problem resolution, communication, content creation and 
          enhancements proposition. She might not take this path but I see a great future for Alexandra in Product/Project Management.

        <p><i class="fas fa-quote-left"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alexandra was one of the pioneers to start the Strategic Account team 
          at Ingenico. A strong technical knowledge together with a good understanding of customers business was needed for that role. 
          Next to that, a very high feeling of responsibility and ownership was key to make it in that team.</p>
          <p>Alexandra is and has all of that: very strong technical interest, knowing what customers are and what they need, 
          able to motivate her self and team members to go every day further.</p>

          she would always go the extra mile. It was very important to her to put the customer's needs first.</p>
          <p>Next to that, she is also very organized and did never hesitate to share useful information with her colleagues. 
            Due to her eagerness to learn and talent for learning, I am positive that she will move forward fast in her career.
